            <p>Another famous Filipino dish, <strong>Lumpiang Shanghai</strong> is often found
                in any kind of pinoy party. It's always a race to get a share of the lumpia, 
                especially when I'm there.</p>

                <li>Combine the ground pork, minced onions, minced carrots, garlic powder,
                     black pepper, salt, sesame oil, and eggs into a bowl and mix well.
                     This will serve as your filling.</li>
                <li>Scoop some of the filling and place it over a sheet of lumpia wrapper.
                    Spread it and fold the wrapper until you attain its iconic shape.</li>
                <li>Fill a pan or pot with oil and heat it. Deep fry your lumpia until 
                    they are a golden brown.</li>
                <li>Put your lumpia in a strainer of some kind and let the excess oil drip.
