            <ol>
                <li>Boil your pork, ginger, and bay leaves in a cooking pot filled with water
                    and salt. After one hour, drain the water.</li>
                <li>Grill your pork for a few minutes per side. Afterwards, let it cool down.</li>
                <li>While the meat is cooling down, prepare the dressing by mixing mayonnaise,
                    vinegar, sugar, salt, liver spread, limes, and black pepper.</li>
                <li>Chop the pork into small pieces. Combine the chopped pork with the onions
                    and the dressing. Mix them all together until they are well blended.</li>
                <li>Transfer your sisig to a sizzling hot plate. Crack open an egg and let it
                    cook over the sisig. Serve and enjoy!</li>
