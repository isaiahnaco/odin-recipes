            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe is for the world famous <strong>Filipino Adobo</strong>, specifically the one
                made with pork. This dish is a personal favorite of mine. Whenever my
                mom prepares it, my day is suddenly much brighter.</p>

            <p>What makes Adobo so interesting is that the steps to make it can be played with
                while still resulting in a delicious meal. However, this recipe will follow
                a very general procedure, something that you can have fun with on your own
                after.</p>
