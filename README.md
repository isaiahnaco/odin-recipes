# odin-recipes
In this project, HTML was used to create a simple website that shares Filipino pork recipes. Here, different headers, unordered, and ordered lists were used to describe each dish, list its ingredients, and dictate the steps to making them.

To visualize the dish, royalty-free images were downloaded. These were then organized into a folder in the repository.

As the project progressed, the student committed each change and addition the website, making it available for other users to view.
